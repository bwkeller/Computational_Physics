\textbf{\Large Homework 6}\\
\textbf{Due: March 9, 2024}\\

\section*{Instructions}
We've finished learning the syntax of C/C++! Hooray! To give our brains a
breather before we get into the wonderful world of computational physics, I've
got an assignment for you here that you can do either on your own or in groups
of 2-3.

Using whatever tool you're most comfortable with (Powerpoint, LaTeX, Figma,
plain text, etc.), write yourself a 1-2 page ``cheat sheet'' for C/C++ syntax.
This will be your helpful guide for the rest of the course so that you don't
need to dive into a textbook or stack overflow if you forget how to phrase a
thing in C/C++. Please send me a PDF of this cheat sheet by the due date, and if
you're OK with it, we can share everyone's cheat sheet on the Discord.  There
will be a prize (along with a good grade) for the best cheat sheet.

If you need inspiration, here are a couple of cheet sheets I find quite good:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \url{https://devhints.io/python}
    \item \url{https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf}
    \item \url{https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/}
    \item \url{https://sheet.shiar.nl/vi}
\end{itemize}
