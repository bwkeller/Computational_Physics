\textbf{\Large Homework 1}\\
\textbf{Due: February 2, 2024}\\
\end{center}
\section*{Instructions}
Please write your code on \texttt{solid.memgalsim.space}, and store your results
in the \texttt{PHYS4420} directory in your home directory.  Make a new directory in there, called \texttt{HW1}, and 
store each question as a separate \texttt{question\_NUM.cpp} file.
\section*{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write a program that prints your name to the screen.
    \item Write a program that subtracts 15 from 87 and displays the result, with an appropriate message.
    \item Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her age. The program then should
    display the age in months:
    \begin{verbatim}
        Enter your age: 29
        Your age in months is 384.
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Write a program that has \texttt{main()} call a user-defined function that takes a Celsius
    temperature value as an argument and then returns the equivalent Fahrenheit value.
    The program should request the Celsius value as input from the user and display
    the result,as shown in the following code: \\
    \begin{verbatim}
        Please enter a Celsius value: 20
        20 degrees Celsius is 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Identify the syntax errors (bugs) in the following program, and then
    write and run a corrected version to ensure you've caught them all.
    \begin{verbatim}
        #include <iostream>

        int main() 
        {
            INT sum;
            /* Compute result of sum
            sum = 25 + 37 - 19
            */ Display Results //
            cout << sum << end;
            return 0;
        }
    \end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}
\end{document}
