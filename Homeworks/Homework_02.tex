\textbf{\Large Homework 2}\\
\textbf{Due: February 9, 2024}\\
\end{center}
\section*{Instructions}
Please write your code on \texttt{solid.memgalsim.space}, and store your results
in the \texttt{PHYS4420} directory in your home directory.  Make a new directory in there, called \texttt{HW2}, and 
store each question as a separate \texttt{question\_NUM.cpp} file.
\section*{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write a program that asks for your weight in integer ounces and then
        converts your weight into pounds and ounces.  Have your program use the
        underscore character to indicate where to type the response. Use the
        \texttt{const} symbolic constant for the conversion factor between
        pounds and ounces.
    \item Write a program that prints out the sizes of the following data types:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \texttt{int}
            \item \texttt{long}
            \item \texttt{long long}
            \item \texttt{short}
            \item \texttt{char}
            \item \texttt{float}
            \item \texttt{double}
            \item \texttt{long double}
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Write a program that asks how many miles you have driven and how many
        gallons of gasoline you have used and then prints the miles per gallon
        you have gotten.
    \item Write a program that asks you to enter a car's gasoline consumption in
        liters per 100 km and converts this to miles per gallon.
\end{enumerate}
