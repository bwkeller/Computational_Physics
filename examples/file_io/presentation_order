- write_text_file.cpp
    - With this one, go through the function examples one-by-one to show the basics of writing text to a file
- format_text.cpp
    - With this one, go through the function examples to show various format options for printing text (mostly floats)
    - You'll also use this one to show that writing text to a file and writing text to the screen with cout are basically the same thing
- write_particles.cpp
    - Show how to write binary and text data
    - Show that it's a lot easier to write out files as a plain binary.
    - Show that the defaults for cout give you a text file that's way bigger than the binary
- read_particles.cpp
    - Show how to read binary and text data
    - Show that you need a _ton_ of precision to get the text version to match the binary.
